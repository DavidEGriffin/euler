Working through Project Euler problems

## Description

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a problem from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/). In each folder, `README.md` shows the problem, lays out my thought process, and provides my solution. The `work.py` file in each folder contains any algorithms I implemented in Python to solve the problems. Respecting the site's rules, no questions after the first hundred are included. All work is my own and without assistance unless otherwise stated.
