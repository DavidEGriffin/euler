# Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 
10 terms will be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Solution

I once again use the power of modern computing to solve the problem simply...

```
>>> fibonacci = [1, 2]
>>> while fibonacci[-1] < 4_000_000:
...     fibonacci.append(fibonacci[-2] + fibonacci[-1])
... 
>>> evens = [
...     number for number in fibonacci
...     if number % 2 == 0
... ]
>>> 
>>> answer = sum(evens)
>>> print(answer)
4613732
```
